    <h3>3.5 miles of Nature and Urban hybird trail in the heart of Dallas</h3>
    <span class="byline">BY Calvin Chu</span>
    <p>In Dallas, abandoned railroad tracks that had once divided the downtown core are rapidly being transformed into the unifying Katy Trail, a linear 3.5-mile-long (5.6 km), landscaped pedestrian, inline skating and bicycle trail system that runs through the most densely developed section of the city. Construction was started in spring 2000. Several features have already been completed, including the 12-foot-wide (3.7 m) primary trail, two of four new entrance plazas and four of the six planned pedestrian bridges.</p>

    <p>Construction was completed in 2007 on the Thomsen Overlook plaza, overlooking Reverchon Park. An 8-foot-wide (2.4 m) secondary jogging trail has 1 mile (1.6 km) left of construction, which will be completed once more funding is secured. The work is being carried out by The Friends of Katy Trail under a master plan created by The SWA Group office, in Dallas.</p>

    <p>The trail's life began when the Union Pacific Railroad, which had bought the Katy, donated the abandoned lines to the city in 1993. The train tracks that are now the location of the Katy Trail formed the major east-bound route through Dallas of the former Missouri-Kansas-Texas (MKT or "Katy") Railroad, which shut down this segment of its network in the late 1980s. The stations, which had served Dallas residents on their trips east for so many years, were torn down, but the tracks remained.</p>

    <p>The Katy Trail is intended to provide an effective way of connecting the various Dallas city parks running from White Rock Lake to the Trinity River Project park system along the Trinity River. The rail trail runs alongside Reverchon Park and the parks system along Turtle Creek, a tributary of the Trinity River.</p>
